    <h2>About Shali Grade Calculator</h2>
    <p>I've designed this grade calculator to help students see where they are in terms of academics and 
      improve their scores based on the internationally accepted GPA (Grade Point Average) range. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Students often study for tests, work on assignments, and get their grade averages from 100. But many of them 
      forget to convert their averages to GPA to observe how good they've achieved in the international standard.
      To solve that unawareness problem, I was inspired to create this simple web app and make it accessible on GitHub
      for everyone who wants to use it. 
    </p>

      <div>The above GPA converion chart is the one I used for my calculator.</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      The website is very simple to use. As soon as you click on the "Go to calculator" button
      below, it sends you to another page containing the calculator. There, you enter your scores of as many
      subjects you want (you can also add the subjects' names but it's optional), and when you click on the "calculate" 
      buttona, it provides you with your GPA, letter grade, and motivational comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have fun using the <em>Shali Grade Calculator</em>!
